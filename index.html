            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I'm a Computational Media Ph.D. student in the Interaction Dynamics Lab at UC Santa Cruz.
                I earned my bachelor's and master's in Applied Mathematics from the Indian Insitute of Technology
                Roorkee (IITR, India) in 2018.
                I served as Data Science Analyst (full-time) at Accenture (India) for three years before joining UC
                Santa Cruz.
                I am primarily interested in user experience, game user research, and Interactive Narrative. Currently,
                my focus is player agency and visualizing it in the context of game narrative.
                Much of the motivation is to gain insights into how player agency allows players to make different
                choices compared to other players or communities.

            &emsp; Role : Qualitative Data Coder and Python Programmer
            &emsp; Status : In-progress <br>
            &emsp; Team :  Bjarke Larsen and Shweta Sisodiya <br>
            &emsp; Advisors: David Thus and Elin Carstensdottir <br>
            <p> In 2021, Priscilla, David, and Carstensdottir conducted a thorough exploration of the term “game mechanics” and discovered approximately 3976 definitions within the academic literature. Through their analysis, they identified 49 explicit definitions and highlighted the ambiguity and lack of agreement among scholars. 
                While the study has some limitations, including its focus primarily on the academic sphere and its failure to address the inherent conflicts and overlapping concepts embedded within these 49 definitions, it still provides valuable insights into the complexities of this term. 
                <br><br>

                Building upon their work, our project is focused on elucidating the distinct yet related interpretations of the term "Game Mechanics" within both academic and industrial contexts. The dataset of 49 definitions from was repurposed to represent academic professionals.
                To construct a similar comprehensive sample of industry professionals, we distilled 22 definitions from a pool of approximately 4932 definitions sourced from three notable venues. The final dataset has 71 definitions that represent academic and industrial spheres. 
                To analyze this dataset, we utilized thematic coding to categorize the definitions into 48 codes that were grouped into eight themes. Despite providing valuable insights into conflicts and shared concepts within the dataset, the thematic coding approach was unsuitable for quantifying these similarities/differences. 
                Rather than striving for a universally accepted definition, our motivation is to appreciate distinct yet related interpretations of “Game Mechanics”. By combining thematic analysis and clustering techniques, we aim to gain a comprehensive understanding of the complex and nuanced interpretations of “Game Mechanics” in various contexts.

            <p> Effective communication is essential in today's diverse and inclusive The default usage of pronouns such as "he" may not appear to be a trivial matter. Yet, it can impede the abilities of individuals who do not conform to traditional gender identities to perceive themselves reflected in language. 
                By perpetuating gender bias through language, we can unconsciously reinforce harmful stereotypes.   We must be mindful of our word choices and embrace gender-inclusive language (GIL) to address these biases. Research indicates that the first step towards adopting effective GIL is simply bringing awareness around this topic and getting familiar with pronouns. 
                For example, using the singular `they' should be preferred over `he' or `she' if the gender identity of the person is unknown. The formal integration of GIL has begun with small yet measurable efforts - instituting GIL using seminars, workshops, videos, etc. Despite formal education, individuals often struggle to implement GIL in their daily interactions. 
                Some of the challenges that individuals face due to a lack of understanding, inconsistency, standardization, and internalized biases and prejudices.
                <br><br>
                To contribute to the ongoing discourse on inclusive language and gender identity, my team and I developed <Strong>SHIBU</Strong>, a Role-Playing Game (RPG) that embraces the power of GIL. 
                The game combines an engaging narrative with interactive gameplay, and its development process is iterative and dynamic, with significant emphasis on player feedback and playtesting. 
                Our project aims to leverage gaming platforms as a unique avenue for promoting and instilling GIL.
                <br><br>
                The game features a gender-neutral superhero, Shibu. The players step into the shoes of novice reporters shadowing Shibu on their adventures, utilizing gender-neutral pronouns to narrate Shibu's actions and character. 
                The game employs Natural Language Processing (NLP) to evaluate player responses and shape the narrative accordingly. 
                Players interact with non-player characters (NPCs) and the gaming environment within a Discord server, ultimately crafting a comprehensive story of their own.

            <h4> Role: Design Team | Advisor: Magy Seif El-Nasr and Elin Carstensdottir | Team : Rëza Habibi, Sai Siddartha Maram, Johannes Pfau, Shweta K. Sisodiya, Atieh Kashani </h4>
            <p> LUX is an Alternate Reality Game (ARG) developed through an iterative design process created with the goal of engaging undergrads at UCSC main campus in a game that uses the campus and the UCSC history.  
                From there, we went through a series of brainstorming phases until we settled in what became The name LUX itself was inspired and is used here as a direct reference to UCSC’s motto “Let There Be Light”, which then became a core part of the narrative. 
                <br><bR>
                
                The narrative proceeds as follows: A mysterious group calling themselves Kerr’s Loyalists (after the founder, Clark Kerr) are looking to hire a group of talented students at UCSC. 
                They claim to be looking into UCSC’s hidden history, and ask the students to help them solve an old crime that happened in UCSC in the 80s. An ancient artefact got stolen, right in the middle of campus. It did not make the news, because UCSC hid the truth, claiming they still have the artefact. 
                However, what the players are not told is that Kerr’s Loyalists have an ulterior motive. This requires a little historical knowledge of UCSC. When UCSC started, it was a different campus than most other universities in the UC system when it was formed in the 60s: It did not give its students grades and was a lot more freeform in its requirements for its students. 
                This all changed over the last decades, as grades were first introduced as an option in the 80s and then a requirement in the 2000s [refs for all that]. Kerr’s Loyalists (back in fiction), wants to get back to that idyll of the 60s—a perhaps noble goal but their way of achieving it are terrible. 
                The players are then taken through this world, solving puzzles to reveal clues about the different characters and actors in this unfolding narrative that bridges on conspiracy, mischief, and different values and principles. 
                As the narrative progresses the players will see themselves torn between different groups or characters. They will need to make decisions, reveal the mystery and stop the wrong group from taking over the campus.
