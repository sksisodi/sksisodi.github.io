                        <p>
                            The term "game mechanics" is widely used across game design, development, and player
                            communities but remains ambiguous and lacks a universally accepted definition. Game
                            mechanics are generally understood to refer to the rules, systems, or interactions that
                            drive gameplay, yet their scope and meaning vary significantly depending on the context in
                            which they are discussed. For example, game mechanics can be interpreted as anything from
                            specific actions a player can take (e.g., jumping, shooting) to broader frameworks like
                            resource management or narrative branching. This lack of a clear and consistent definition
                            leads to confusion in both academic and industry discussions, making it difficult to
                            accurately communicate and evaluate game design processes.

                        <p>
                            This project adopts a mixed-method research approach, to develop an understanding of the
                            term "Game Mechanics" by exploring its interpretations in academic and industrial contexts.
                            Building on previous research that identified 49 varied definitions of the term “Game
                            Mechanics” in the academic sphere, this project seeks to expand that work by analyzing these
                            49 and additional 22 industry-specific definitions. By using a mixed-method approach, we aim
                            to highlight the distinct yet related interpretations between these two sectors, offering
                            clearer insights into how "Game Mechanics" is understood and applied. The project is focused
                            on appreciating these differences rather than arriving at a universally accepted definition.

                        <p>
                            One of the key challenges faced during this project was the complexity and ambiguity
                            surrounding the term "Game Mechanics." With thousands of definitions available, it was
                            difficult to distill a manageable sample while ensuring it represented both academic and
                            industrial viewpoints. Additionally, while thematic coding helped categorize the
                            definitions, it was insufficient for quantifying the relationships between them. Another
                            challenge involved the subjectivity of qualitative data, where nuances and context must be
                            carefully analyzed, making it difficult to find patterns without relying on manual and
                            time-intensive methods like thematic analysis.

                            This project has significantly impacted my growth both as a qualitative data analyst and a
                            programmer. By working on this project, I’ve deepened my understanding of the complexities
                            involved in defining core concepts like "Game Mechanics" in different contexts. The
                            opportunity to apply clustering algorithms to analyze qualitative data has also strengthened
                            my programming skills and introduced me to new ways of interpreting large datasets. More
                            importantly, this project has enhanced my ability to navigate the intersection between
                            academia and industry, helping me appreciate the nuances of research across different
                            sectors.

                                Initially, we performed thematic coding on the
                                qualitative data( 71 definitions ) that was collected through extensive literature
                                reviews. We used open coding to label each definition and then grouped these codes into
                                broader thematic categories through axial coding. We observed 48 codes, which were then
                                grouped into eight themes. <br>
                                <br>
                                <b>b. K-means Clustering on Thematic Data</b> <br>
                                To further analyze
                                and identify patterns within the data, we applied the K-means clustering algorithm.
                                Since K-means is designed for numerical data, we first numerically encoded the
                                qualitative themes based on the frequency of occurrence, presence of specific codes, or
                                other relevant metrics. <br>
                                <br>
                                <b>Encoding Process:</b> Each unit of analysis was quantified based
                                on the codes we identified during thematic coding. This numerical representation of code
                                allowed us to structure the data in a format suitable for K-means clustering.<br>
                                <br>
                                <b>Clustering:</b> The K-means algorithm was then applied to cluster the themes into distinct
                                groups. Since we using this for qualitative data, we applied a <b>modified K-means
                                clustering algorithm</b> that uses <b>Levenshtein distance</b> instead of traditional Euclidean
                                distance. This approach allowed us to measure the linguistic similarity between themes
                                or textual elements, clustering them based on how closely related they were in terms of
                                textual structure rather than numerical representation. <b> Clustering Evaluation and
                                Selection of Optimal k:</b> We performed an evaluation to identify the optimal number of
                                clusters (k) by running the algorithm for k = 4 to k = 11. The goal was to identify the
                                most accurate and meaningful clustering of the themes within our dataset. To do this, we
                                used two key evaluation methods: t-SNE visualization and the silhouette score. t-SNE
                                (t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding) was used to visualize the clustering
                                results for different values of k. t-SNE is a dimensionality reduction technique that
                                allowed us to project the high-dimensional data (in this case, the clusters of themes
                                based on Levenshtein distance) into a 2D or 3D space. By visualizing the clusters using
                                t-SNE, we could visually assess the separation between clusters and determine whether
                                the clusters were well-defined or overlapped.The visualizations helped us identify
                                whether increasing or decreasing the number of clusters led to clearer and more distinct
                                groupings of the themes. To complement the visual assessment, we used the silhouette
                                score to quantitatively evaluate the quality of clustering for each value of k. For each
                                value of k, we calculated the average silhouette score across all data points to
                                determine how well-separated the clusters were. Based on these evaluations, we
                                determined that k = 6 provided the best balance between cluster separation and
                                interpretability of the themes.<br>

                                The clusters produced
                                by K-means helped us identify underlying patterns and relationships between themes that
                                may not have been immediately apparent through manual analysis. Each cluster represented
                                a group of related themes, which provided deeper insights into the main trends and
                                commonalities in the participants' responses. From our analysis, we concluded that the
