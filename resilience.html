            <h3>Project Resilience</h3>
            <p><strong>Role: Design Team </strong>  <br> Advisor: Magy Seif El-Nasr and Elin Carstensdottir <br> Team : RÃ«za Habibi, Sai Siddartha Maram, Johannes Pfau, Shweta K. Sisodiya, Atieh Kashani </p>
            <p> LUX - a name that echoes UCSC's motto "Let There Be Light" - is an Alternate Reality Game (ARG) that I had the pleasure of contributing to in many capacities. Designed to pique the curiosity of UCSC undergrads, 
                it's a labyrinthine tale woven into the very fabric of the campus and its history. <br><br>

                Our collective tale commences with a secret heist from the 80s, when an ancient artifact was stealthily stolen from the heart of UCSC - a truth concealed under layers of time. Our fictitious group, the Kerr's Loyalists, 
                named after UCSC's founder Clark Kerr, engage the brightest minds on campus to unearth this enigma. As the players venture further, they uncover the underlying agenda of the Loyalists - a yearning for the olden days of UCSC, 
                characterized by the freedom of a gradeless system. My multifaceted role in this project had me juggling various responsibilities. As a programmer, I laid the digital foundation that allowed LUX to come alive. Within the design team, 
                I was part of the process that sculpted the game's narrative and puzzles, creating an absorbing world of mystery, conflict, and differing ideologies. I also undertook the task of recruiting playtesters to ensure our narrative and puzzles 
                delivered an enthralling and intellectually stimulating experience. As the narrative advances, players find themselves tangled in a battle for power, making critical decisions and unearthing hidden truths. Working within this talented team, 
                my diverse contributions to the project culminated in an engaging journey that invites players to delve beneath the surface, exploring the profound depths of UCSC's history and values. <br><br>
