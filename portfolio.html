            <h3>Game Mechanics [In-progress]</h3> 
            <P><strong> Role : Qualitative Data Coder and Python Programmer </strong><br>
                   Team :  Bjarke Larsen and Shweta Sisodiya <br>
                   Advisors: David Thus and Elin Carstensdottir </p>
            <p> Inspired by pioneering work in the field, I embarked on an ambitious project to shed light on the intricate and often convoluted interpretations of the term "Game Mechanics" within academic and industrial landscapes. 
                The core of this exploration was a carefully curated dataset, encapsulating a multitude of perspectives from both spheres. <br><br>
                
                My approach to analyzing this extensive dataset is twofold. First, I (along with my team) began with thematic coding, categorizing the vast array of definitions into manageable codes and themes. 
                This method provided valuable insights but fell short when it came to quantifying the nuanced differences and similarities across definitions.
                Thereore, I turned to the power of Python programming to implement clustering the extensive qualitative dataset.  <br><br>
                
                This innovative blend of methods, though challenging, was my key to unlock the treasure of understanding. My approach, straddling the worlds of quantitative and qualitative research, enabled a fresh perspective on the diverse interpretations of "Game Mechanics."

                In this exciting expedition, I not only furthered our understanding of game mechanics but also showcased the power of mixed-methods research. This project, a testament to innovation and determination, underscores the value of bridging gaps and illuminating complexities.<br><br>

                Stay tuned as this project is still in progress, with more enlightening discoveries and in-depth insights to be shared soon!

            <h3>Shibu</h3>
            <p><strong> Role: Project Lead </strong><br> Advisor: Elin Carstensdottir and Magy Seif El-Nasr <br> Team : Shweta K. Sisodiya, Sai Siddartha Maram and Alex Calderwood </p>
            
            <p> Effective communication is essential in today's diverse and inclusive The default usage of pronouns such as "he" may not appear to be a trivial matter. Yet, it can impede the abilities of individuals who do not conform to traditional gender identities to perceive themselves reflected in language. 
                By perpetuating gender bias through language, we can unconsciously reinforce harmful stereotypes.   We must be mindful of our word choices and embrace gender-inclusive language (GIL) to address these biases. Research indicates that the first step towards adopting effective GIL is simply bringing awareness around this topic and getting familiar with pronouns. 
                For example, using the singular `they' should be preferred over `he' or `she' if the gender identity of the person is unknown. The formal integration of GIL has begun with small yet measurable efforts - instituting GIL using seminars, workshops, videos, etc. Despite formal education, individuals often struggle to implement GIL in their daily interactions. 
                Some of the challenges that individuals face due to a lack of understanding, inconsistency, standardization, and internalized biases and prejudices.
                <br><br>
                To contribute to the ongoing discourse on inclusive language and gender identity, my team and I developed <Strong>SHIBU</Strong>, a Role-Playing Game (RPG) that embraces the power of GIL. 
                The game combines an engaging narrative with interactive gameplay, and its development process is iterative and dynamic, with significant emphasis on player feedback and playtesting. 
                Our project aims to leverage gaming platforms as a unique avenue for promoting and instilling GIL. The game features a gender-neutral superhero, Shibu. The players step into the shoes of novice reporters shadowing Shibu on their adventures, utilizing gender-neutral pronouns to narrate Shibu's actions and character. 
                The game employs Natural Language Processing (NLP) to evaluate player responses and shape the narrative accordingly. 
                Players interact with non-player characters (NPCs) and the gaming environment within a Discord server, ultimately crafting a comprehensive story of their own.

            <h3>Project Resilience</h3>
            <p><strong>Role: Design Team </strong>  <br> Advisor: Magy Seif El-Nasr and Elin Carstensdottir <br> Team : RÃ«za Habibi, Sai Siddartha Maram, Johannes Pfau, Shweta K. Sisodiya, Atieh Kashani </p>
            <p> LUX - a name that echoes UCSC's motto "Let There Be Light" - is an Alternate Reality Game (ARG) that I had the pleasure of contributing to in many capacities. Designed to pique the curiosity of UCSC undergrads, 
                it's a labyrinthine tale woven into the very fabric of the campus and its history. <br><br>

                Our collective tale commences with a secret heist from the 80s, when an ancient artifact was stealthily stolen from the heart of UCSC - a truth concealed under layers of time. Our fictitious group, the Kerr's Loyalists, 
                named after UCSC's founder Clark Kerr, engage the brightest minds on campus to unearth this enigma. As the players venture further, they uncover the underlying agenda of the Loyalists - a yearning for the olden days of UCSC, 
                characterized by the freedom of a gradeless system. My multifaceted role in this project had me juggling various responsibilities. As a programmer, I laid the digital foundation that allowed LUX to come alive. Within the design team, 
                I was part of the process that sculpted the game's narrative and puzzles, creating an absorbing world of mystery, conflict, and differing ideologies. I also undertook the task of recruiting playtesters to ensure our narrative and puzzles 
                delivered an enthralling and intellectually stimulating experience. As the narrative advances, players find themselves tangled in a battle for power, making critical decisions and unearthing hidden truths. Working within this talented team, 
                my diverse contributions to the project culminated in an engaging journey that invites players to delve beneath the surface, exploring the profound depths of UCSC's history and values. <br><br>
