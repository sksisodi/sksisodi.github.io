                            The contribution of this project is the development of Shibu, a role-playing game designed
                            to promote and instill gender-inclusive language (GIL) by combining an engaging narrative
                            with interactive gameplay aimed at raising awareness and addressing gender biases in
                            communication.

                        <h1>Problem Statement</h1>
                        <p>
                            In today's increasingly diverse and inclusive environments, the use of gendered
                            language,particularly personal pronouns, which can unintentionally perpetuate gender biases
                            and exclude individuals who do not conform to traditional gender identities, is a matter of
                            debate. Despite growing awareness around gender-inclusive language (GIL) through seminars,
                            workshops, and formal education, many individuals still struggle to implement it
                            consistently in everyday interactions. This inconsistency stems from a lack of
                            understanding, internalized biases, and the absence of standardized approaches, making it
                            difficult to foster more inclusive communication practices. This particularly becomes even
                            more challenging for English as a Second language (ESL) speakers.

                        <p>
                            This project primarily aims to research how we can promote GIL adoption by creating an
                            interactive and engaging platform for users to practice and become familiar with inclusive
                            pronoun usage. In this project, we designed and developed a role-playing game, Shibu. The
                            game seeks to combine entertainment with education, offering an innovative, practical tool
                            that encourages players to reflect on their language choices.

                    <div class="details-section" id="Challenges">
                        <h1>Challenges</h1>
                        <p>
                            One of the biggest challenges in developing this project is the complexity of language,
                            which is often supplemented by context and cultural nuances. These nuances make it difficult
                            to standardize language rules, particularly when addressing the fluidity of gender identity.
                            To address this, the project team had to carefully consider how narratives and storytelling
                            could be woven into the game to help users internalize GIL more naturally. By incorporating
                            contextual scenarios that reflect real-life situations, the game can help players better
                            understand how language shapes identity and how to apply GIL effectively, even in nuanced
                            interactions.
                        </p>

                    <div class="details-section" id="Impact">
                        <h1>Impact</h1>
                        <p>
                            This project has had a profound personal impact on me, both as the lead developer and as
                            someone who speaks English as a second language. Working on Shibu has deepened my
                            understanding of the complexities of language, particularly how subtle biases can manifest
                            in communication. As a non-native speaker, I initially found pronoun usage to be a
                            challenge, but through this project, I’ve gained a greater awareness of how these challenges
                            extend to both native and non-native speakers alike. Leading this project has not only
                            strengthened my technical and leadership skills but has also transformed the way I approach
                            language and inclusivity in my everyday interactions. By creating a tool that educates
                            others on gender-inclusive language, I’ve also learned how to navigate and promote more
                            equitable communication for myself and those around me.

                        <h2>Generative Steps:</h2>
                        <p>
                            Autoethnography: Of three researchers on this team, 2 were English as a second language
                            speakers who shared the same culture, societal, and religious values. We, as researchers,
                            kept and recorded our daily experiences, struggles, and challenges of using GIL. This step
                            allowed us, as the researcher to explore their own lived experience as both a learner and a
                            user of GIL. This adds depth to the research by focusing on how individual learners grapple
                            with learning new language structures and social norms related to gender inclusivity.
                        </p>
                        <h2>Insights from Authethnography:</h2>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Lack of Familiarity with Non-Binary Pronouns: We as learners struggled with using
                                non-binary pronouns like "they/them" as singular pronouns because we’ve traditionally
                                been taught that "they" is plural in English grammar. This grammatical shift can cause
                                confusion and hesitation. </li>
                            <li>Cultural and Societal Norms: In our cultures, gender norms are
                                deeply embedded in language and society. Using GIL might feel unfamiliar or even
                                socially uncomfortable, especially since we come from societies where gender is strictly
                                binary (male/female). </li>

                            <li>Grammar and Syntax Complexity: GIL introduces complexity, such as
                                using singular "they" and avoiding gendered terms like "he/she," "sir/ma’am," or
                                "man/woman." The complexities of grammar (e.g., subject-verb agreement with singular
                                "they") can lead to confusion and be difficult for ESL speakers, such as us, who are
                                still mastering English grammar and vocabulary. For example, ESL speakers struggle to
                                correctly use "they" in sentences like "They is/are going to the store." This can slow
                                down adoption and create frustration. </li>

                            <li>Fear of Making Mistakes: As ESL speakers navigate
                                unfamiliar territory, we fear using GIL incorrectly, especially if we are unsure of
                                pronouns or terminology. This can lead to hesitation or avoidance of GIL altogether.
                            </li>

                            <li>Lack of Practice: We observed that as ESL speakers, we don’t get enough opportunities to
                                practice GIL before using it for real conversations, leading to difficulties in adopting
                                it fluently.</li>

                            <li>Lack of Clear Guidance or Resources: We also noticed that as ESL speakers,
                                we may find that there is limited guidance or learning materials explicitly designed to
                                teach GIL. Most ESL curricula are still based on traditional grammar and gender norms,
                                with little emphasis on inclusivity.</li>

                            <li>Translational Barriers: Translating GIL from
                                English into our native language is very difficult. Many languages have strict gendered
                                nouns, pronouns, or verb forms, and the concept of gender neutrality might not exist.
                                Hence, speakers might find it difficult to reconcile GIL in English with their native
                                language’s gendered structure. For example, in languages like Hindi, nouns, adjectives,
                                and verbs are gendered, and we were not sure how to adapt English's gender-neutral
                                concepts into our native linguistic framework.</li>

                            <li>Emotional or Cognitive Overload: Adopting
                                GIL requires mental effort, especially when speakers are already dealing with the
                                challenges of mastering a second language. The added layer of gender inclusivity might
                                feel overwhelming for some.</li>
                        </ol>

                            Researching Existing Games: A variety of existing games and tools have already addressed
                            gender identity and inclusivity, often with positive outcomes. Several games offering
                            diverse gender options, like avatar customization, lead to increased knowledge and
                            acceptance of gender diversity among players. Serious games like Gender Quest, Respectful
                            Relationship, and Queers in Love at the End of the World have been successfully used to
                            educate players on gender neutrality, stereotypes, and biases. While these efforts
                            contribute significantly to the broader conversation around gender equality and
                            representation, explicit focus on the use of personal pronouns and gender-inclusive language
                            in games is still in its early stages, indicating room for growth and further development in
                            this space.

                        <p>
                            We designed a text-based RPG that features a gender-neutral superhero, Shibu. The players
                            step into the shoes of novice reporters shadowing Shibu on their adventures, utilizing
                            gender-neutral pronouns to narrate Shibu's actions and character.  The game was designed to
                            be hosted on a discord server, it employs Natural Language Processing (NLP) to evaluate
                            player responses and shape the narrative accordingly. Players interact with non-player
                            characters (NPCs) and the gaming environment within a Discord server, ultimately crafting a
                            comprehensive story of their own.

                        <h1>Evaluative Research</h1>
                        <p>
                            We organized extensive playtesting sessions followed by semi-structured interviews. We
                            recruited individuals to playtest our game, aiming for a diverse group that included
                            specific personal pronoun users, non-native English speakers, and native English speakers.
                            Our final group consisted of nine participants, with three of us hosting three playtesting
                            sessions each as the "Editor." All playtesters were invited to our discord server, "Santa
                            Clara Times." Upon joining a pre-assigned channel, the "Editor" welcomed them, asked for
                            their consent via a Google form, and registered them as players. Once ready, the game,
                            lasting around 15-20 minutes, commenced.  The Editor would present a visual and request
                            players to narrate the scene. The Editor's script was designed to encourage players to
                            employ personal pronouns and elaborate their descriptions, which would allow the language
                            model to accurately analyze the text. At the end of the playtesting, the Editor would inform
                            the player about the instances where their use of personal pronouns might have been
                            inappropriate. Additionally, this playtesting session was followed by semi-structured
                            interviews.

                        <h2>Insights we learned from Playtesting and Semi-Structured Interviews:</h2>
                        <ol id="insights-list">
                            <li><b>Curiosity and Discussion Sparked by GIL:</b> The inclusion of GIL in the game generated
                                curiosity and discussion among the players. This indicates that GIL can serve as a
                                conversation starter and educational tool, even in environments where it may not be
                                widely practiced.</li>
                            <li><b>Increased Carefulness and Familiarity Toward the End:</b> Toward the end of the game,
                                players exhibited greater carefulness and familiarity with using inclusive language.
                                This suggests that prolonged exposure to GIL in the game context helped players become
                                more accustomed to it, signaling the potential for game-based learning to effectively
                                reinforce inclusive language practices over time.</li>
                            <li><b>Default to Male Pronouns or Roles:</b> From our playtesting session, we observed that the
                                majority of players defaulted to using male pronouns or assigning male roles to
                                characters, particularly when gender was unspecified. This suggests that players rely on
                                ingrained linguistic or cultural habits when gender cues are absent. When we asked about
                                this during interviews, most of the players still defaulted to the use of male pronouns
                                for various NPCs from the game.</li>
                            <li><b>Visual Cues Influence Pronoun Usage (Specific to Superhuman Shibu):</b> The visual design of
                                the character "Superhuman Shibu" strongly influenced players' pronoun choices, with
                                players being more likely to adjust pronouns based on the character's appearance. This
                                indicates that visual cues can play a crucial role in guiding players' understanding and
                                adoption of gender-inclusive language (GIL), though this effect was less prominent with
                                other characters.</li>
                            <li><b>Inconsistency with Non-Player Characters (NPCs):</b> A significant observation was the
                                inconsistent use of pronouns with NPCs. Players did not maintain a consistent approach
                                to assigning pronouns, which suggests that either the cues provided by NPCs were unclear
                                or that players found it challenging to track and implement GIL when interacting with
                                multiple characters.</li>
                            <li><b>Struggle with Using Certain Pronouns:</b> When prompted or nudged to use non-traditional or
                                gender-neutral pronouns, many players demonstrated difficulty. This highlights a lack of
                                familiarity or comfort with gender-inclusive pronouns, suggesting the need for more
                                guidance or practice opportunities to build confidence.</li>
                            <li><b>Typing Full-Text Responses Was Challenging for Players:</b> The game required players to
                                type their responses. Players found it difficult to type out full-text responses,
                                particularly when responding to open-ended questions or prompts that required thoughtful
                                reflection on gender pronouns. This suggests that simplifying input methods or offering
                                shortcuts (e.g., pronoun selection menus) could enhance the overall user experience and
                                reduce friction in the adoption of GIL.</li>
