        <h3>Shibu</h3>

            <p> Effective communication is essential in today's diverse and inclusive The default usage of pronouns such as "he" may not appear to be a trivial matter. Yet, it can impede the abilities of individuals who do not conform to traditional gender identities to perceive themselves reflected in language. 
                By perpetuating gender bias through language, we can unconsciously reinforce harmful stereotypes.   We must be mindful of our word choices and embrace gender-inclusive language (GIL) to address these biases. Research indicates that the first step towards adopting effective GIL is simply bringing awareness around this topic and getting familiar with pronouns. 
                For example, using the singular `they' should be preferred over `he' or `she' if the gender identity of the person is unknown. The formal integration of GIL has begun with small yet measurable efforts - instituting GIL using seminars, workshops, videos, etc. Despite formal education, individuals often struggle to implement GIL in their daily interactions. 
                Some of the challenges that individuals face due to a lack of understanding, inconsistency, standardization, and internalized biases and prejudices.
                <br><br>
                To contribute to the ongoing discourse on inclusive language and gender identity, my team and I developed <Strong>SHIBU</Strong>, a Role-Playing Game (RPG) that embraces the power of GIL. 
                The game combines an engaging narrative with interactive gameplay, and its development process is iterative and dynamic, with significant emphasis on player feedback and playtesting. 
                Our project aims to leverage gaming platforms as a unique avenue for promoting and instilling GIL. The game features a gender-neutral superhero, Shibu. The players step into the shoes of novice reporters shadowing Shibu on their adventures, utilizing gender-neutral pronouns to narrate Shibu's actions and character. 
                The game employs Natural Language Processing (NLP) to evaluate player responses and shape the narrative accordingly. 
                Players interact with non-player characters (NPCs) and the gaming environment within a Discord server, ultimately crafting a comprehensive story of their own.
